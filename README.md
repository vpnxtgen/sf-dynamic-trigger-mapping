# sf-dynamic-trigger-mapping
A metadata-driven Salesforce framework using custom objects that dynamically syncs fields between related records from triggers. Admins configure source–target objects, lookups, and field mappings via custom object records — making the solution flexible, reusable, and deployment-free for future changes.
